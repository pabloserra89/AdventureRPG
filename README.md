<h1 align="center">Adventure RPG (Zelda Like)</h1>

<h3 align="left">Hi Everybody!</h3>
<h3 align="left">In this project I will try to develop a ZeldaLike game with the purpose of learn how to develop its mechanics</h3>

The mechanics developed by now are:
- BREAKABLE POTS!
- Health System with Hearts (partially damaged/healed)
- Dash ability
- Magic ability (Mana/Magic system)
- Sword attack
- Inventory system
- Interaction with signs and NPCs
- Different enemies with simple IA
- Dungeon with Doors (Interactable doors, switch doors, enemy doors)
- Room transition
- Scene transition

Everything can be improve, but I rather tring new mechanics that spend a lot of time in a particular one.

You can try it by downloading the latest stable release:
